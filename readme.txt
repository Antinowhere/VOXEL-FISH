# Swimming with the fishes 

This is a simple 3D voxel sea simulation. 

The only learning objective was to master Three.js to be able to produce a 3D web app enviornment with sound and interactivity.  

The music is called "Don't be sad" - I own the rights to it.

Run: node server.js if testing locally.
